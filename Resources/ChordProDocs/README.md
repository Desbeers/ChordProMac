# ChordPro for macOS

## What is ChordPro

**ChordPro**, the application, is first and foremost a command-line application and the reference implementation for the **ChordPro** standard:

> “A simple text format for the notation of lyrics with chords”.

The package you downloaded contains this powerful but maybe *hard-to-use* application that you have to run in the `Teminal`.

It is wrapped in a very pleasant and easy to use graphical application that gives you the basics of using **ChordPro**; both the application as well its text-format.

We called this graphical application also **ChordPro**; because *why not*?

## It is not easy

Providing applications for the Mac platform is not as easy as it seems. For the users, its mostly just *drag and drop*. It is not that easy for developers. Apple has a [lot of security](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/secf826eff27/web) in place to make sure your *drag and drop* will be safe for you.

It needs a lot of time, effort and yeh... money for developers to provide such application for the Mac.

**ChordPro** is not a commercial product. It is an *Open Source* application made by volunteers. You are welcome to [download the source](https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro), compile it and enjoy!

That is not realistic for must users, especially not on the Mac. We would love to provide you the expected experience but we can’t. There is nobody in the **ChordPro** community with an Apple Developers certificate to provide you this *ready to go* experience.

## Installation

Your download contains a *almost* ready to go **ChordPro**; except is is *ours* and not *yours* yet. An application on the Mac must be [signed](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec3ad8e6e53/web) to run. Signed by an approved Apple Developer or signed by you.

Your download is signed by *us* now, not approved by Apple. You can’t run it. If you want to use it; you have to *re-sign* it so it becomes *yours*.

The `Install` script will do this for you if you want.

> Open the Terminal application and just *drag and drop* the `Install` script into it. It will explain what it is going to do.

**It will not do anything without your permission but by providing your administration password, you will give us a *carte-blanche*.** 

Just review the script beforehand; there is a good reason it is not *clickable*...

## Enjoy!

Hopefully, you will get our application up-and-running!

We hope you appreciate our best efforts.

The Mac is a beautiful platform for its users.
