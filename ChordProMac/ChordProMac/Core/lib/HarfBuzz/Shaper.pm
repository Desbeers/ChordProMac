=head1 NAME

HarfBuzz::Shaper - Use HarfBuzz for text shaping

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use HarfBuzz::Shaper;
    my $hb = HarfBuzz::Shaper->new;
    $hb->set_font('LiberationSans.ttf');
    $hb->set_size(36);
    $hb->set_text("Hello!");
    my $info = $hb->shaper;

The result is an array of hashes, one element for each glyph to be typeset.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HarfBuzz::Shaper is a perl module that provides access to a small
subset of the native HarfBuzz library.

The subset is suitable for typesetting programs that need to deal with
complex languages like Devanagari, Hebrew or Arabic.

This module is intended to be used with module L<Text::Layout>. Feel
free to (ab)use it for other purposes.

Following the above example, the returned info is an array of hashes,
one element for each glyph to be typeset. The hash contains the
following items:

    ax:   horizontal advance
    ay:   vertical advance
    dx:   horizontal offset
    dy:   vertical offset
    g:    glyph index in font (CId)
    name: glyph name

Note that the number of glyphs does not necessarily match the number
of input characters!

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This module provides a thin interface layer between Perl and the
native HarfBuzz library. It is agnostic with regard to the details of
multi-language typesetting. HarfBuzz has a friendly community to help
you.

sub new {
    my ( $pkg, $opts ) = @_;

    $opts //= {};

    my $self = bless {} => $pkg;
    $self->{harfbuzz} = hb_version_string();
    $self->{buffer} = hb_buffer_create();
    $self->{features} = [];

	$self->set_font( delete $opts->{font} );
    }
    if ( $opts->{size} ) {
	$self->set_size( delete $opts->{size} );
    }

    return $self;
}

=head2 $hb->reset( [ I<full> ] )

Reset (clear) the buffer settings for font, size, language, direction
and script. With I<full>, also clears the font cache.

=cut

sub reset {
    my ( $self, $full ) = @_;

    for ( qw ( font size text language direction script shaped ) ) {
	delete $self->{$_};
    }
    if ( $full ) {
	for ( keys %$self ) {
	    next unless /^(font|face)_/;
	    delete $self->{$_};
	}
	hb_buffer_reset( $self->{buffer} );
	# So basically we are like freshly created.
    }

    $self;
}

=head2 $hb->set_font( I<font filename> [ , I<size> ] )

Explicit way to set the font (and, optionally, the size) used for
shaping.

The settings persist across shaper() calls. Call without arguments to
remove the settings.

The font must be a TrueType or OpenType font. Font information is
cached internally, after the first call subsequent calls with the same
font filename are very fast.

=cut

sub set_font {
    my ( $self, $fontfile, $size ) = @_;

    delete $self->{shaped};
    unless ( defined $fontfile or defined $size ) {
	delete $self->{font};
	delete $self->{size};
	return $self;
    }

    croak("$fontfile: $!\n") unless -s -r $fontfile;
    my $blob = hb_blob_create_from_file($fontfile);
    my $face = $self->{"face_$fontfile"} //= hb_face_create( $blob, 0 );
    $self->{font} = $self->{"font_$fontfile"} //= do {
	# hb_font_create should default to OT.
	my $font = hb_font_create( $face );
	hb_ot_font_set_funcs($font);
	$font;
    };
    $self->set_size($size) if $size;

    $self;
}

=head2 $hb->set_size( I<size> )

Explicit way to set the font size used for shaping.

Note that the font size will in general affect details of the
appearance, A 5 point fontsize magnified 10 times is not identical to
50 point font size.

The setting persist across shaper() calls. Call without arguments to
remove the setting.

=cut

sub set_size {
    my ( $self, $size ) = @_;

    delete $self->{shaped};
    unless ( defined $size ) {
	delete $self->{size};
	return $self;
    }

    $self->{size} = $size;

    $self;
}

=head2 $hb->set_text( I<text> [ , ... ] )

Sets the text to shape. Multiple arguments are concatenated.

Note that the text must be Perl strings.

The setting persist across shaper() calls. Call without arguments to
remove the setting.

=cut

sub set_text {
    my ( $self, @text ) = @_;

    delete $self->{shaped};
    unless ( @_ > 1 and defined $text[0] ) {
	delete $self->{text};
	return $self;
    }

    $self->{text} = join( "", @text );

    $self;
}

=head2 $hb->set_features( I<feat> [ , ... ] )

Sets persistent features for shaping. Features are strings as described in
L<https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-common.html#hb-feature-from-string>
and
L<https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-feature-settings/#values>.

Multiple feature strings may be supplied.

Call without arguments to remove the persistent features.

=cut

sub set_features {
    my ( $self ) = shift;
    $self->{features} = [];
    $self->add_features(@_) if @_ && defined($_[0]);
    return $self;
}

=head2 $hb->add_features( I<feat> [ , ... ] )

Just like set_features, but the specified features are I<added> to the
set of persistent features.

=cut

sub add_features {
    my ( $self, @features ) = @_;
    delete $self->{shaped};
    foreach my $feature ( @features ) {
	push( @{ $self->{features} },
	      hb_feature_from_string($feature)
	      || croak("Unknown shaper feature: \"$feature\"") );
    }
}

=head2 $hb->set_language( I<lang> )

Sets the language for shaping. I<lang> must be a string containing a
valid BCP-47 language code.

The setting persist across shaper() calls. Call without arguments to
remove the setting.

=cut

sub set_language {
    my ( $self, $lang ) = @_;

    delete $self->{shaped};
    unless ( defined $lang ) {
	delete $self->{language};
	return $self;
    }

    $self->{language} = $lang;
    # This is merely for checking validity;
    hb_buffer_set_language( $self->{buffer}, $lang );
}

=head2 $hb->get_language

Returns the language currently set for this shaper, as a string.

When called after a successful shaper() call, it returns the actual
value used by shaper().

=cut

sub get_language {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    hb_buffer_get_language( $self->{buffer} );
}

=head2 $hb->set_script( I<script> )

Sets the script (alphabet) for shaping. I<script> must be a string
containing a valid ISO-15924 script code. For example, C<"Latn"> for
the Latin (Western European) script, or C<"Arab"> for arabic script.

If you don't set a script, shaper() will make a guess based on the
text string. This may or may not yield desired results.

The setting persist across shaper() calls. Call without arguments to
remove the setting.

=cut

sub set_script {
    my ( $self, $script ) = @_;

    delete $self->{shaped};
    unless ( defined $script ) {
	delete $self->{script};
	return $self;
    }

    $self->{script} = $script;
    # This is merely for checking validity;
    hb_buffer_set_script( $self->{buffer}, $script );
}

=head2 $hb->get_script

Returns the script currently set for this shaper, as a string.

When called after a successful shaper() call, it returns the actual
value used by shaper().

=cut

sub get_script {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    hb_buffer_get_script( $self->{buffer} );
}

=head2 $hb->set_direction( I<dir> )

Sets the direction for shaping. I<dir> must be a string containing a
valid direction setting: LTR (left-to-right), RTL (right-to-left), TTB
(top-to-bottom), or BTT (bottom-to-top).

If you don't set a direction, shaper() will make a guess based on the
text string. This may or may not yield desired results.

The setting persist across shaper() calls. Call without arguments to
remove the setting.

=cut

sub set_direction {
    my ( $self, $dir ) = @_;

    delete $self->{shaped};
    unless ( defined $dir ) {
	delete $self->{direction};
	return $self;
    }

    $self->{direction} = $dir;
    # This is merely for checking validity;
    hb_buffer_set_direction( $self->{buffer}, $dir );
}

=head2 $hb->get_direction

Returns the direction currently set for this shaper, as a string.

When called after a successful shaper() call, it returns the actual
value used by shaper().

=cut

sub get_direction {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    hb_buffer_get_direction( $self->{buffer} );
}

=head2 $info = $hb->shaper( [ I<ref to features> ] )

Performs the actual shape operation.

I<features> is a reference to an array of feature strings. The
features will be I<added> to the list of features already set with
set_features/add_features. If the first (or only) feature is C<none>
all current features will be ignored and only subsequent features are
taken into account. Changes apply to this call only, the persistent
set of featutes is B<not> modified.

Upon completion an array of hashes is returned with one element for
each glyph to be rendered.

The hash contains the following items:

    ax:   horizontal advance
    ay:   vertical advance
    dx:   horizontal offset
    dy:   vertical offset
    g:    glyph index in font (CId)
    name: glyph name

Note that the number of glyphs does not necessarily match the number
of input characters!

    $self->{shaped} = 1;
    return $info;
}

=head2 $info = $hb->get_extents

Get the extents of the (shaped) buffer.

Upon completion an array of hashes is returned with one element for
each glyph.

The hash contains the following items:

    x_bearing  Distance from the x-origin to the left extremum of the glyph.
    y_bearing  Distance from the top extremum of the glyph to the y-origin.
    width;     Distance from the left extremum of the glyph to the right extremum.
    height     Distance from the top extremum of the glyph to the bottom extremum.
    g          Glyph index in font (CId)

The values are scaled to the font size as set with set_size().

Note that the number of glyphs does not necessarily match the number
of input characters!

    }

    return $info;
}

=head2 $info = $hb->get_font_extents(dir)

Get the extents of the font in the given direction.

I<dir> may be omitted, it defaults to the direction currently set, or
C<'ltr'> if no direction was set.

Upon completion returns a hash with the following items:

    ascend     The height of typographic ascenders.
    descend    The height of typographic ascenders.
    line_gap   The suggested line-spacing gap.

The values are scaled to the font size as set with set_size().

Note that typically ascender is positive and descender negative, in
coordinate systems that grow up.
